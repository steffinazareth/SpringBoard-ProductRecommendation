# SpringBoard Rescue: User Research and Product Recommendation

This project was done as a part of the Product and Brand Management course at CMU.

As a part of this project we: 
1. Evaluated SpringBoardâ€™s current product offering to identify their target customer segment.
2. Assessed how SpringBoard can better serve their existing customers by identifying user pain points and forming a hypothesis for it.
3. Developed a prototype for a product recommendation after conducting user interviews to validate the hypothesis generated.

Detailed summary of the project can found in this [presentation](SpringBoardRescue_Presentation.pdf )

**This project was done in collaboration with: Vera Schulz and Ruian Pan. **
